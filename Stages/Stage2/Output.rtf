[Question] Which of these states is farthest north?\
[Choices] West Virginia, Louisiana, Arizona, Oklahoma\
[Lecture] Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions. Those directions are north, south, east, and west.\
A compass rose is a set of arrows that point to the cardinal directions. A compass rose usually shows only the first letter of each cardinal direction.\
The north arrow points to the North Pole. On most maps, north is at the top of the map.\
[Hint] \
[Solution] To find the answer, look at the compass rose. Look at which way the north arrow is pointing. West Virginia is farthest north.\

To disable this warning, you can either:\
        - Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible\
        - Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)\

Chain-of-Thought:\
\
To answer this question, we need to have a basic understanding of the geographical locations of these states in the United States. \
\
West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States, but it is often considered part of the Mid-Atlantic states. \
\
Louisiana is located in the southeastern region of the United States, on the Gulf of Mexico. \
\
Arizona is located in the southwestern region of the United States, bordering Mexico.\
\
Oklahoma is located in the South Central region of the United States, north of Texas.\
\
Comparing these locations, we can see that West Virginia, being part of the Mid-Atlantic states, is located further north than Louisiana, Arizona, and Oklahoma.\
\
Final Answer:\
\
West Virginia is the state that is farthest north among the given options.\
