    --Output example 1---
    Correct answer: West Virginia

    Let’s break it down:

    -What is a compass rose?
    It's a symbol on a map that shows directions—north, south, east, and west.
    Most maps have north at the top.

    -How can we tell which state is farthest north?
    Look at where each state is placed on the map.
    The one that is farthest toward the top is the most northern.

    So based on the map and the directions, West Virginia is the correct choice.

    ---Output example 2---
    Correct answer: West Virginia
    The question asks which state is farthest north. When looking at a map, we use the compass rose to help us figure out directions. 
    The compass rose shows us where north is—usually up on the map. So, the state that is placed closest to the top is the farthest north.
    That means the correct answer is West Virginia. It is located higher up than Louisiana, Arizona, and Oklahoma.
