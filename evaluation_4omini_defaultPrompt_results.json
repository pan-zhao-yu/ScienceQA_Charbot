Cooper's experiment is focused on whether water freezes more quickly than apple juice, while Zane's experiment examines the expansion of apple juice compared to water when they freeze.\n\n2. **Identifying the Choices**: The choices for Tom and Justin's experiment are:\n   - Does apple juice expand more or less than water when it freezes?\n   - Does water freeze more quickly than apple juice?\n\n3. **Analyzing the Choices**: \n   - The first choice (\"Does apple juice expand more or less than water when it freezes?\") relates to the physical property of expansion during the freezing process.\n   - The second choice (\"Does water freeze more quickly than apple juice?\") pertains to the rate of freezing.\n\n4. **Connecting to Previous Experiments**: Since the context provided mentions that Cooper's experiment is about the freezing rate and Zane's is about expansion, we can infer that Tom and Justin's experiment should also relate to one of these topics. \n\n5. **Determining the Best Fit**: Given that the question is asking for the best fit for Tom and Justin's experiment, we need to decide which of the two choices aligns more closely with the experimental focus.

Typically, we denote alleles as follows:\n   - Dominant allele (normal): A\n   - Recessive allele (affected): a\n\n   The genotypes can be:\n   - Homozygous dominant (AA)\n   - Heterozygous (Aa)\n   - Homozygous recessive (aa)\n\n2. **Setting Up the Punnett Square**: To calculate the probability of offspring being homozygous dominant (AA), we need to know the genotypes of the parent goats involved in the cross. However, since the specific genotypes of the parents are not provided in the context, we can make some assumptions based on common scenarios.\n\n   Let's assume a common cross:\n   - Parent 1: Homozygous dominant (AA)\n   - Parent 2: Heterozygous (Aa)\n\n   The Punnett square for this cross would look like this:\n\n   |   | A | A |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | A | AA | AA |\n   | a | Aa | Aa |\n\n   From this Punnett square, we can see the possible genotypes of the offspring:\n   - 2 AA (homozygous dominant)\n   - 2 Aa (heterozygous)\n\n   This gives us a total of 4 offspring:\n   - 2 AA out of 4 total = 2/4 = 1/2 probability of being homozygous dominant.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Choices**: The choices provided are:\n   - 1/4\n   - 0/4\n   - 4/4\n   - 2/4\n   - 3/4\n\n   Based on our calculation, the probability of being homozygous dominant (AA) is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. However, since 1/2 is not listed among the choices, we need to check if we made any assumptions that could lead to a different conclusion.\n\n4. **Considering Other Crosses**: If we consider a cross between two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa), the Punnett square would be:\n\n   |   | A | a |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | A | AA | Aa |\n   | a | Aa | aa |\n\n   This results in:\n   - 1 AA\n   - 2 Aa\n   - 1 aa\n\n   The probability of being homozygous dominant (AA) is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Given the choices and the analysis, if we assume the cross is between two heterozygous goats (Aa x Aa), the probability that a goat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the myotonia congenita gene is indeed 1/4.\n\nFinal Answer: 1/4"

The goal is to enhance the clarity, precision, and overall impact of the writing.\n\n1. **Identifying Key Areas for Improvement**: \n   - The excerpt contains several instances where the verbs and adjectives could be more vivid or precise. For example, phrases like \"I didn't know what I was getting into\" could be more specific about the writer's feelings or expectations. \n   - The use of \"sweating profusely\" is somewhat dramatic but could be replaced with a more direct verb that conveys the same emotion without redundancy.\n   - The phrase \"put it in the sink\" is quite plain and could be replaced with a more descriptive verb that captures the action more vividly.\n\n2. **Evaluating Suggested Revisions**: \n   - The hint suggests using more precise verbs such as \"announced,\" \"realize,\" \"adore,\" \"abhor,\" \"demonstrate,\" \"gripped,\" \"clanged,\" \"retrieved,\" \"deposited,\" \"selected,\" and \"sliced.\" These verbs can replace more generic terms and add depth to the writing.\n   - For example, instead of \"got the knife,\" using \"retrieved the knife\" or \"gripped the knife\" would convey a more active and engaged action.\n\n3. **Considering the Overall Tone and Flow**: \n   - The excerpt has a narrative quality, and the revisions should maintain this while enhancing the expressiveness of the language. The goal is to make the writing more engaging and to better reflect the writer's emotional state and actions.\n\n4. **Finalizing the Answer**: \n   - The best way to improve the word choice in the excerpt is to replace generic verbs with more specific and vivid alternatives. This will enhance the reader's understanding of the writer's experience and emotions during the cooking class.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is that the writer can best improve his or her word choice by using more precise verbs, as indicated in the hint. \n\nFinal Answer: The writer could best improve his or her word choice by using more precise verbs."

The context provided mentions an experiment where fertilizer is the independent variable, and the height of pea plants is the dependent variable.\n\n2. **Purpose of a Control Group**: A control group is essential because it serves as a baseline for comparison. By having a group of pea plants grown without fertilizer (the control group), we can observe the natural growth of the plants without any intervention. This allows us to determine if the changes observed in the experimental group (the plants with fertilizer) are indeed due to the addition of fertilizer and not other factors.\n\n3. **Eliminating Confounding Variables**: The control group helps to eliminate confounding variables. It ensures that any differences in plant height can be attributed to the fertilizer rather than other environmental factors, such as soil quality, light, or water availability.\n\n4. **Drawing Conclusions**: By comparing the results from the experimental group and the control group, researchers can draw more reliable conclusions about the effect of the independent variable (fertilizer) on the dependent variable (plant height).\n\nIn summary, the control group is crucial for establishing a point of reference, ensuring that the results of the experiment are valid and that the conclusions drawn are based on the effect of the variable being tested.\n\nFinal Answer: A control group is used to provide a baseline for comparison, allowing researchers to determine the effect of the independent variable (fertilizer) on the dependent variable (plant height)."
